                                        </header>
                                        <p>After being laid-off multiple times, I found myself questioning whether or not I was a good employee, was my work not to their standards, what could I have done better, was my continued education all for nothing...many different thoughts ran through my mind.  During those transitional times, it was a very stressful and tough.  When requesting for assistance, I felt like a number.  There was no human  compassion in the process.  I was a single parent, unemployed, and had to figure how to make ends meet.  Your anxiety increases between applying for jobs, interviewing, and wishful thinking of that dream job emailing you back to say, "We want to make you an offer."  In the meantime, the clock is ticking for your unemployment to run out.  It just makes you want to scream. </p>
                                        <p>Looking on the bright side of things, this process allowed me to really utilized my resources whether using my own skills and knowledge, taking on courses offered through unemployment, learning to navigate through several job boards, or networking with others.  The reason for starting Bear-A-Hand is to bring a human touch of compassion while helping individuals in transition with resumes, job searches, networking, and other requested services. </p>
